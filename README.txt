I answered problems one and two.


***To execute tests, please enter "cucumber" from the 'Lightspeed/' directory in your console.***

Relevant output should be printed to the console.



Note:   To execute problem two (the twitter one), you need to input your twitter credentials
        in Lightspeed/resources/configurations.yml

        You may also need to gem install 'selenium-webdriver' and 'gem install cucumber'
        if you haven't already.



Versions of software on personal machine:

    selenium-webdriver v. 3.12.0
    chrome v. 67.0.3396.99-1
    chromedriver v. 2.40.565383
    ruby v. 2.4.1p111
    cucumber v. 3.1.1
